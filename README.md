# Object-Lab-Interface
	This is the newest version of the Object Lab Interface software.
Originally worked on by the Towson Software Engineering, followed by DavidJPrince. We (class of Spring 2016) are now picking up where the last class left off and hope to release a program that will allow Towson universityâ€™s object lab to function more efficiently.
